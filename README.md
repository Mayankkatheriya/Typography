The basic staructure is designed by only using HTML\
first make a "div" of class "container" contains all the elemnts:<br>
1. "h2" for the heading
2. "img" for the image
3. "p" for paragraph writing
4. "iframe" for embed video  from youtube
<br>
we put h2, p, iframe in a div of class "data" each seperately so we can define its CSS froperty seperatly
